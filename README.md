# BasicBankingSystem
This is a project I made using HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP and PHP. It's a simple banking system that provides you list of registered customers, transfer money, and manage your balance. If you're interested in web development or want to see how a banking system works, you can check out the code in this repository.
